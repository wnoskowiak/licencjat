abstract = {We present the Fortran package H2SOLV for an efficient computation of the nonrelativistic energy levels and the wave functions of diatomic two-electron molecules within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The wave function is obtained as a linear combination of the explicitly correlated exponential (Kołos–Wolniewicz) functions. The computations of H2SOLV are performed within the arbitrary-precision arithmetics, where the number of working digits can be adjusted by the user. The key part of H2SOLV is the implementation of the algorithm of an efficient computation of the two-center two-electron integrals for arbitrary values of internuclear distances developed by one of us (Pachucki, 2013). This have been one of the long-standing problems of quantum chemistry. The code is parallelized, suitable for large-scale computations limited only by the computer resources available and can produce highly accurate results. As an example, we report several benchmark results obtained with H2SOLV, including the energy value accurate to 18 decimal digits.

    abstract = { Extensive variational computations are reported for the ground state energy of the non-relativistic two-electron atom. Several different sets of basis functions were systematically explored, starting with the original scheme of Hylleraas. The most rapid convergence is found with a combination of negative powers and a logarithm of the coordinate s = r1 + r2. At N = 3091 terms we pass the previous best calculation (Korobov's 25 decimal accuracy with N = 5200 terms) and we stop at N = 10257 with E = -2.90372, 43770, 34119, 59831, 11592, 45194, 40444, …. Previous mathematical analysis sought to link the convergence rate of such calculations to specific analytic properties of the functions involved. The application of that theory to this new experimental data leaves a rather frustrating situation, where we seem able to do little more than invoke vague concepts, such as "flexibility." We conclude that theoretical understanding here lags well behind the power of available computing machinery. }
